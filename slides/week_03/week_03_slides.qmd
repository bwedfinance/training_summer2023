# Homework Review

## Solving a common problem with the homework

# Reintroductions and Icebreaker

## Icebreaker

What is one interesting or weird thing you have learned about your state's funding formula recently?

What is one burning question or topic you hope we'll delve into today?

## Reintroducing Ourselves

-   Bonnie O'Keefe, Senior Associate Partner and Instructor
-   Jenn Schiess, Senior Partner and Instructor

# Today's Objectives

## Objectives

Our primary objective today is to go deeper on the policy dimensions of state funding formula structures.

-   Discuss perspectives on what "good" looks like in principle and within your states of interest.
-   Think about key considerations for school funding advocacy at the state level.
-   Discuss how these policy dimensions might inform your policy goals and shape analysis and simulator design.

# Key Principles for Assessing School Funding Policies

## How can we assess state school funding policies? (1/2)

School finance reform is often prompted by court action (or the potential for court action).

School finance litigation has historically focused on one or both of two standards:

-   Adequacy: Is there enough funding in the system to enable schools to meet the state's educational mandate?
-   Equity: Are resources distributed fairly across communities?

## How can we assess state school funding policies? (2/2)

Our working framework for assessing state finance policies considers four principles:

-   Adequacy
-   Equity
-   Responsibility
-   Transparency

## How are we defining these four policies?

| Adequacy       | Is there enough money in the system? How do we know?                                                                                                                         | An adequate school finance system provides sufficient funding through the state's formula to support a rigorous, high-quality education for all students.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Equity         | Is funding distributed fairly across communities? Is funding distributed through mechanisms that target more funding to greater student needs?                               | An equitable school finance system targets funding to districts based on the educational needs of students, resulting in comparable funding in districts with comparable student populations.                                                                                                                                                       |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Responsibility | Do local leaders have the responsibility for making the best spending decisions to meet student needs? Are state leaders able to make needed adjustments with relative ease? | A state school finance system ensures that every district has the resources required to meet the needs of every student, but the responsibility for determining how to spend resources to meet those needs rests with district (and school) leaders, with accountability measures and guardrails to support success and protect equity.             |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Transparency   | Are formulas only as complex as they need to be? Does reporting of revenue and expenditures create a feedback loop between student needs and state funding?                  | If adequacy and equity criteria are met, then revenues should reflect student populations and needs. If the responsibility criterion is met, then expenditures should also track student need. Transparency ensures that reporting on both sides supports accountability at both the state and local levels and clarity for community stakeholders. |

## There are 3 major types of funding formulas currently used by states

+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Category**   | **Definition**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
+================+==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================+
| Student-Based  | School districts receive funding based on the number of students enrolled or in attendance. In many cases, districts may additionally receive funding weights or supplement based on anticipated student learning needs, with extra funds tied to characteristics of enrolled students, such as low income, disability, and/or status as an English learner. |
+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Resource-Based | School districts receive funding based on the anticipated cost of resources and inputs, such as staff salaries and instructional materials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Program-Based  | This system allocates dollars to school districts based on the cost of educational programs within those districts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

# Good, Better, Best -- Common Features of Student-Based Funding Formulas

## A strong weighted student formula addresses both how funding levels are set and the mix of state and local funds

The primary elements of a weighted student formula typically include:

-   Base amount: Reflects the cost of educating a single student and should be uniform across the state.
-   Student adjustments: Additional weights for student groups with extra learning needs.

Some formulas may also include district-level adjustments to account for community conditions that affect costs, such as sparsity or concentrated poverty.

## State overview: Formula type and base funding

THIS WILL NEED TO FILLED IN AS WE KNOW WHICH STATES ARE GOING TO BE IN THE COHORT. WE WILL WANT TO INCLUDE THE STATE, FORMULA TYPE, AND BASE FUNDING.

## The base amount is the foundational formula element

The base amount should reflect the cost of educating a single student and should be uniform across the state.

-   If your state has a base funding amount, would you characterize it as adequate, inadequate, too generous?
-   How does it factor into funding policy conversations-- is it a "known" figure that features in debate/discussion or more of a "hidden" element?

## The type of student characteristics that receive weights and the size of those weights vary by state

+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Student Characteristic         | Recommended Policy Considerations                                                                                                                                              |

| Grade Level                    | -   Fully fund pre-K and full-day kindergarten in the formula                                                                                                                  |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Gifted and Talented            | -   Funding based on "census" assumption (assume a percentage of the student population is gifted and fund that percentage)                                                    |
|                                |                                                                                                                                                                                |
|                                | -   Fold it the funding into the base per-pupil amount                                                                                                                         |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Career and Technical Education | -   Many states have a weight or programmatic funding stream to incentivize participation and cover equipment and partnership costs for specialized CTE                        |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

## Some state formulas adjust for district characteristics that can create differences in costs

Two common types of district adjustments are:

-   Adjustments for small enrollment/sparsely populated districts designed to compensate for diseconomies of scale or disadvantage linked to sparseness or geographic remoteness
-   Adjustments for Cost of Living differences within states

+------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| District Characteristic      | Recommended Policy Considerations                                                                                                                                                                                                |
+==============================+==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================+
| Sparsity or scale adjustment | -   Create a sliding scale weight for each student enrolled in a sparse district that is higher where student population density is lower and phases out at greater density                                                      |
|                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                              | -   Differentiating through two weights \-- one sliding scale sparsity weight and one flat rate for enrollment in isolated districts                                                                                             |

+------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Cost of Living               | -   Avoid within-state cost of living adjustments because higher cost communities tend to also be higher wealth, which means directing more funding through a cost of living weight can undermine other equity-based adjustments |

## State overview: Funding for student and district characteristics

ADD IN A TABLE THAT HAS THE CHARACTERISTICS FOR THE STATES THAT ARE IN THE COHORT

## How are student or district characteristics considered in your state's funding formula?

-   Are there any categories of student or district your state does not have weights or funding streams for that you wish you did?
-   Would you characterize funding allocated for low-income students, English language learners, and/or students with disabilities as adequate and equitably distributed? Why or why not?

## Addressing state/local revenue share is essential to protecting all the pro-equity elements of a funding formula

Nearly all states require local districts to contribute local revenues to fund at least a portion of their formula entitlement-- often referred to as the local share

Many states also limit the extent to which local districts can raise additional local funds.

A well-constructed policy will achieve two goals:

-   Requires a proportional contribution from local districts that aligns with each district's ability to generate funds based on the local tax base
-   Prevents districts from generating substantial funding above their expected contribution that creates inequity among district resources for education, and results in inefficient state funding

## Characteristics of a good local share policy

-   Set a uniform required local share tax rate statewide, the amount raised locally at that rate determines the local share of the formula, with state funds filling in any gaps.
-   If the local revenue raised exceeds the formula expectations (for example, through voter approval), redistributes some or all excess local revenues.
-   If districts are permitted to levy additional local taxes, allocate "equalizing" state dollars to less property-wealthy districts.

ADD IN A TABLE WITH THE STATES THAT ARE IN THE COHORT

## How do our example states treat local taxes in their state funding systems?

-   How are you thinking about the role of local funds in your systems? What's your ideal?
-   What practical or political challenges do you anticipate around potentially changing the role of local funds?

## States often have different funding rules for public schools of choice (e.g. charters & magnets)

Funding policies for schools of choice a lot from state to state, and issues like facilities, transportation, and access to local funds can be highly contentious. Often one key factor is state authorizing laws -- is the school its own LEA, is it authorized by a traditional district, or some other structure (multidistrict regional schools, etc.)?

One advantage of a student-based weighted funding system for schools of choice is that they can usually be funded through the same student-based mechanisms. But, schools of choice don't always have direct access to local revenue, and district/community-based measures like sparsity may not apply.

| Topic                 | Recommended Policy Considerations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
+=======================+================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================+
| Local/State Revenue   | -   Requiring pass-through of local and state revenue from districts to local schools of choice that are not district-authorized creates an antagonistic relationship between those schools and the home district, and can create a misleading perception of district funding. |
|                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|                       | -   Where schools are state authorized or independently authorized, full state funding is likely the most transparent funding structure.                                                                                                                                       |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Student-Based Funding | -   Wherever applicable, schools of choice should have access to the same student-based funding mechanisms as traditional districts.                                                                                                                                           |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Other Considerations  | -   Transportation and facilities funding are two common pain-points for schools of choice. If it's not feasible to apply a version of district rules, a programmatic fund might be a solution.                                                                                |

# Advocacy Considerations

Understanding context is essential. Advocates should consider the following questions:

-   **What is driving the will to change?** The circumstances may dictate what's possible or what's probable -- a funding reform effort driven by a court mandate might look different than one that's trying to stave off a lawsuit or one that's driven by principle or availability of revenue to spend. The driver of change can affect the political will, timing and urgency, and magnitude of possible change.
-   **What are the political dynamics around school funding?** Every policymaker represents school districts, which can sometimes muddy the political coalitions that more typically fall along party lines. In addition, strongly held values (such as "local control") can make some policy recommendations non-starters.
-   **What other contextual factors are in play?** Competing major policy initiatives (e.g. federal stimulus), state revenue conditions, and other factors can significantly affect what's possible.

## Bringing people along through complex policy considerations is critical

Policy change doesn't happen in a spreadsheet. It's made by people. Ask yourself:

-   **What is the base of understanding and how much groundwork needs to be done to educate policymakers**? Policymakers grapple with multiple complex issues, and often there are few members with deep understanding and expertise on school funding systems. Advocates will likely benefit from building the bench of knowledgeable policymakers and can have significant impact on how policymakers think about school finance.
