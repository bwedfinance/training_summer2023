# Homework Review

## Solving a common problem with the homework

# Reintroducations and Icebreaker 

## Icebreaker 

What is one interesting or weird thing you have learned about your state's funding formula recently? 

What is one burning question or topic you hope we’ll delve into today?

## Reintroducing Ourselves 

- Bonnie O'Keefe, Senior Associate Partner and Instructor 
- Jenn Schiess, Senior Partner and Instructor 

# Today's Objectives 

## Objectives 

Our primary objective today is to go deeper on the policy dimensions of state funding formula structures. 

- Discuss perspectives on what “good” looks like in principle and within your states of interest.
- Think about key considerations for school funding advocacy at the state level.
- Discuss how these policy dimensions might inform your policy goals and shape analysis and simulator design.

# Key Principles for Assessing School Funding Policies 

## Review: How can we assess state school funding policies? (1/2)

School finance reform is often prompted by court action (or the potential for court action).

School finance litigation has historically focused on one or both of two standards: 

- Adequacy: Is there enough funding in the system to enable schools to meet the state's educational mandate? 
- Equity: Are resources distributed fairly across communities? 

## Review: How can we assess state school funding policies? (2/2)

Our working framework for assessing state finance policies considers four principles: 

- Adequacy 
- Equity 
- Responsibility 
- Transparency 

## How are we defining these four policies? (1/2)

Adequacy: Is there enough money in the system? How do we know? 

- An adequate school finance system provides sufficient funding through the state’s formula to support a rigorous, high-quality education for all students. 

Equity: Is funding distributed fairly across communities? Is funding distributed through mechanisms that target more funding to greater student needs?

- An equitable school finance system targets funding to districts based on the educational needs of students, resulting in comparable funding in districts with comparable student populations.

## How are we defining these four policies? (1/2)

Responsibility: Do local leaders have the responsibility for making the best spending decisions to meet student needs?
