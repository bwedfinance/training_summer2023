Participants will be equipped with the content knowledge and technical skills to analyze K-12 education finance data, understand their state’s funding formula, and begin to create interactive tools to model and visualize proposed policy changes.\nThe training will prepare advocates to understand and advocate effectively for school finance reforms that can improve the educational success of historically underserved students — especially students of color, multilingual learners, students with disabilities, and/or economically disadvantaged students — and on ensuring that they attend equitably and sufficiently funded schools to provide them with an excellent education."
